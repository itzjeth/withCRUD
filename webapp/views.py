Regular consultation with academic advisers or program coordinators can also help you plan your subjects carefully and avoid unnecessary delays in your journey toward graduation.""",

#Many Absences are allowed
    "How many absences are allowed",

Should a student's total number of absences go beyond this 20 percent limit, regardless of the reason, the instructor or the University administration reserves the right to officially drop the student from the course. Being dropped due to excessive absences may negatively affect your academic record and could also delay your progress toward fulfilling the requirements for graduation.
<br><br>
It is therefore strongly advised that students attend all classes diligently and, if unavoidable circumstances arise (such as illness or emergencies), promptly communicate with their instructors and submit any necessary documentation to explain their absences. Staying proactive and responsible in managing attendance is essential for maintaining good academic standing and ensuring successful completion of your courses.""",

The ID also helps faculty and staff easily identify students, which contributes to the overall safety and orderliness of the campus.

#Join Student Organization
    "How do I join student organizations",
    """Joining a student organization at the University is an excellent way to enhance your academic experience, develop new skills, and build a network of peers who share your interests and passions. The process for joining student organizations generally involves several steps, which are designed to help you find the best fit for your personal and academic goals.
<br><br>
First and foremost, it’s important to research the different student organizations available at the University. These organizations cover a wide range of interests, from academic clubs, leadership groups, and volunteer organizations, to hobby-based, cultural, and sports clubs. Many student organizations host interest meetings or orientation events at the beginning of each semester where you can learn more about their objectives, activities, and membership requirements. These meetings are an excellent opportunity to ask questions and determine if the organization aligns with your interests.
<br><br>
Once you’ve found an organization that you would like to join, you typically need to fill out a membership application form. This form is often available through the organization’s official social media pages, the Student Affairs Office, or the student organization’s booth during university events like organization fairs. The application may ask for basic personal information, academic standing, and your reasons for wanting to join the group.
<br><br>
After submitting your application, some organizations may require interviews, entrance exams, or other selection processes to ensure that members are fully committed and capable of contributing to the group’s activities. However, many organizations welcome all students, regardless of experience or background, and simply ask that you attend a few initial meetings or participate in an introductory event before officially becoming a member.
<br><br>
It’s also essential to remember that active participation is key in student organizations. Once you become a member, you will be expected to attend regular meetings, participate in events, and contribute to projects or activities, depending on the organization’s purpose. Some organizations may also ask for a nominal membership fee to help fund their events, activities, or initiatives, but this fee is generally affordable and goes towards the upkeep of the club’s operations.
<br><br>
Lastly, it’s important to stay informed about upcoming opportunities to join organizations, especially during Club Week or Student Organization Recruitment events held at the beginning of each semester. Keep an eye on campus bulletin boards, official university websites, and social media accounts for announcements about these events.
<br><br>
Joining a student organization is an enriching part of university life that offers a chance to meet like-minded individuals, develop valuable skills, and contribute to the campus community. Don’t hesitate to get involved and explore the many opportunities available to you!

This means that you are required to retake and pass any subjects that were either failed or left incomplete during your academic journey before you can officially graduate.
<br><br>
Clearing these subjects is important because the University’s graduation requirements are designed to ensure that students have met all the necessary academic standards and have gained the knowledge and skills expected for their degree program. Academic deficiencies are viewed as obstacles to fulfilling these standards, and the University cannot award a degree until all the required coursework is completed.

If you have back subjects, it is your responsibility to work with the academic department or course instructors to make arrangements for retaking the courses. This might include enrolling in special summer classes, attending remedial classes, or following the proper procedures to resolve any incomplete grades.

Students who have academic deficiencies are encouraged to address them promptly to avoid delays in their graduation timeline. The University often has academic advisors or counselors who can provide guidance on how to clear these deficiencies and how to manage your course load in subsequent semesters.
