#Failed a prerequisite subject
    "What happens if I fail a subject",

Prerequisites are carefully set by the University to ensure that students have the necessary background and skills to succeed in higher-level courses.

In many cases, if the failed prerequisite subject is only offered once per academic year, you may have to wait until the following school year to retake it. This can cause a delay in your academic progress, especially if the prerequisite is critical for a series of other subjects.

It is also important to understand that even if you are already classified as a 4th-year student, you may still be required to enroll in and complete lower-year (1st-year) subjects that you were not able to pass previously. Your academic year standing (e.g., 2nd year, 3rd year, 4th year) does not exempt you from completing all required courses under your curriculum.
<br><br>
For this reason, students are strongly advised to prioritize passing all prerequisite courses early in their studies and to seek academic support if they are struggling.

     "what happens if I fail a subject",
    """If you fail a subject, you are required to retake and pass the course before you are allowed to enroll in any subsequent subject that depends on it. Prerequisites are carefully set by the University to ensure that students have the necessary background and skills to succeed in higher-level courses.
<br><br>
In many cases, if the failed prerequisite subject is only offered once per academic year, you may have to wait until the following school year to retake it. This can cause a delay in your academic progress, especially if the prerequisite is critical for a series of other subjects.
<br><br>
It is also important to understand that even if you are already classified as a 4th-year student, you may still be required to enroll in and complete lower-year (1st-year) subjects that you were not able to pass previously. Your academic year standing (e.g., 2nd year, 3rd year, 4th year) does not exempt you from completing all required courses under your curriculum.
<br><br>
For this reason, students are strongly advised to prioritize passing all prerequisite courses early in their studies and to seek academic support if they are struggling. Regular consultation with academic advisers or program coordinators can also help you plan your subjects carefully and avoid unnecessary delays in your journey toward graduation.""",

#Many Absences are allowed

<br><br>
Should a student's total number of absences go beyond this 20 percent limit, regardless of the reason, the instructor or the University administration reserves the right to officially drop the student from the course. Being dropped due to excessive absences may negatively affect your academic record and could also delay your progress toward fulfilling the requirements for graduation.
<br><br>
It is therefore strongly advised that students attend all classes diligently and, if unavoidable circumstances arise (such as illness or emergencies), promptly communicate with their instructors and submit any necessary documentation to explain their absences. Staying proactive and responsible in managing attendance is essential for maintaining good academic standing and ensuring successful completion of your courses.""",

#Join Student Organization
    "How do I join student organizations",
    """Joining a student organization at the University is an excellent way to enhance your academic experience, develop new skills, and build a network of peers who share your interests and passions. The process for joining student organizations generally involves several steps, which are designed to help you find the best fit for your personal and academic goals.
<br><br>
First and foremost, it‚Äôs important to research the different student organizations available at the University. These organizations cover a wide range of interests, from academic clubs, leadership groups, and volunteer organizations, to hobby-based, cultural, and sports clubs. Many student organizations host interest meetings or orientation events at the beginning of each semester where you can learn more about their objectives, activities, and membership requirements. These meetings are an excellent opportunity to ask questions and determine if the organization aligns with your interests.
<br><br>
Once you‚Äôve found an organization that you would like to join, you typically need to fill out a membership application form. This form is often available through the organization‚Äôs official social media pages, the Student Affairs Office, or the student organization‚Äôs booth during university events like organization fairs. The application may ask for basic personal information, academic standing, and your reasons for wanting to join the group.
<br><br>
After submitting your application, some organizations may require interviews, entrance exams, or other selection processes to ensure that members are fully committed and capable of contributing to the group‚Äôs activities. However, many organizations welcome all students, regardless of experience or background, and simply ask that you attend a few initial meetings or participate in an introductory event before officially becoming a member.
<br><br>
It‚Äôs also essential to remember that active participation is key in student organizations. Once you become a member, you will be expected to attend regular meetings, participate in events, and contribute to projects or activities, depending on the organization‚Äôs purpose. Some organizations may also ask for a nominal membership fee to help fund their events, activities, or initiatives, but this fee is generally affordable and goes towards the upkeep of the club‚Äôs operations.
<br><br>
Lastly, it‚Äôs important to stay informed about upcoming opportunities to join organizations, especially during Club Week or Student Organization Recruitment events held at the beginning of each semester. Keep an eye on campus bulletin boards, official university websites, and social media accounts for announcements about these events.
<br><br>
Joining a student organization is an enriching part of university life that offers a chance to meet like-minded individuals, develop valuable skills, and contribute to the campus community. Don‚Äôt hesitate to get involved and explore the many opportunities available to you!
